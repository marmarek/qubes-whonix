    title: Tor has been permanently set to disabled
    message: |
      <p><b>Tor has been permanently set to disabled!</b></p>
      <p>The qubes service option <b>whonix-tor-disable</b> is currently set which
      means this Whonix-Gateway will always start with Tor disabled.</p>
      <p>This feature is useful to ensure Tor will not start and provide an
      opportunity to configure a proxy before connecting to Tor for the first
      time. After configuring the gateway, be sure to remove the
      <b>whonix-tor-disabled</b> service option before restarting the gateway
      which will then proceed to boot the gateway with whatever settings have been
      made and prevent this warning</p>
